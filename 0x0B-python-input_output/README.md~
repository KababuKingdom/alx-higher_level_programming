## 9-student.py

A class ``` Student ``` that defines a student by:

- Public instance attributes:
  * ``` first_name ```
  * ``` last_name ```
  * ``` age ```
- Instantiation with ``` first_name ```, ``` last_name ``` and ``` age ```: ``` def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age): ```.
- Public method ``` def to_json(self): ``` that retrieves a dictonary representation of a ``` Student ``` instance.

## 10-student.py

A class ``` Student ``` that defines a student by: (based on ``` 9-student.py ```)

- Public instance attributes:
  * ``` first_name ```
  * ``` last_name ```
  * ``` age ```
- Instantiation with ``` first_name ```, ``` last_name ``` and ``` age ```: ``` def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age): ```.
- Public method ``` def to_json(self, attrs=None): ``` that retrieves a dictonary representation of a ```Student ``` instance.
  * If ``` attrs ``` is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list are retrieved.
  * Otherwise, all attributes are retrieved.

## 11-student.py

A class ``` Student ``` that defines a student by: (based on ``` 10-student.py ```)

- Public instance attributes:
  * ``` first_name ```
  * ``` last_name ```
  * ``` age ```
- Instantiation with ``` first_name ```, ``` last_name ``` and ``` age ```: ``` def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age): ```.
- Public method ``` def to_json(self, attrs=None): ``` that retrieves a dictonary representation of a ```Student ``` instance.
        * If ``` attrs ``` is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list are retrieved.
        * Otherwise, all attributes are retrieved.
- Public method ``` def reload_from_json(self, json): ``` that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
  * Assumption: ``` json ``` will always be a dictionary.
  * A dictionary key will be the public attribute name.
  * A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute.
## 12-pascal_triangle.py

A function ``` def pascal_triangle(n): ``` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the s triangle of n:

- Returns an empty list if ``` n <= 0 ```
- You can assume ``` n ``` will be always an integer
- You are not allowed to import any modulePascal
